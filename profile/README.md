# Product Capstone - CloudByMe - Bangkit Academy 2023

CloudbyMe is a mobile application for weather prediction and analysis where this application helps users in forecasting the weather in an area so that users become aware of the weather or the surrounding environment. The weather application that we made has several advantages where we take several datasets from the data of each area so that the data has a high level of accuracy. In addition, the application has votes for user feedback to make it easier for other users to know the actual weather in the area.
